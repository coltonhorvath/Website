				<h1>The Lords of Cinder</h1>
				<img src="loc.jpg">
				<p><q style="font-style:italics";>If the lords will not return to their thrones themselves, 
				let them return as cinders.</q> <br><br>
				One becomes a Lord of Cinder by relinking the First Flame 
				in the Kiln and Surviving. There are currently 5 Lords of 
				Cinder, all 5 of their ashes are needed to reenact the 
				Linking of the First Flame.  The 5 Lords are Aldrich Saint
				of the Deep, Ludleth the Exiled, Yhorm the Giant, Farron&#39;s 
				Undead Legion, and Lothric, the Last hope of his line.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="lore_content">
				<h1>The Unkindled, Ashen One</h1>
				<img src="ashen.jpg">
				<p><q>Only in truth the lords will abandon their 
				thrones and the unkindled will rise. Nameless accursed undead, 
				unfit even to be cinder. And so it is, that ash seeketh embers.</q> <br><br>
				As the intro says, the Unkindled are beings of ash, 
				unworthy to ascend to become Lords of Cinder. 
				They are awakened by the tolling of a Bell that 
				rings when the First Flame is in danger of fading. 
				They awaken in the Cemetery of Ash and seek the embers
				of the First Flame. During the whole game the 
				protagonist is called Unkindled, Champion of Ash or Ashen 
				One all of which harken back to the origins of the unkindled.<br><br>
				Whatever unkindled are, their task is clear. They have 
				to seek out the Lords Of Cinderin order to reenact relinking 
				the First Flame and preserve the age of fire. They  are also 
				undead who are not fully bound by the hollowing process we saw in 
				past games,  needing to acquire Dark Sigils in order to go Hollow. 
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="lore_content">
				<h1>Ludleth the Exiled</h1>
				<img src="ludleth.jpg">
				<p> Ludleth the Exiled linked the First Flame long ago by willing himself to. 
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="lore_content">
				<h1>Aldrich, Saint of the Deep</h1>
				<img src="aldrich.jpg">
				<p>Aldrich is another Lord of Cinder that neglected his duties, having his 
				own ambitions after the linking of the fire. He was a cleric in 
				the past but at some point he started eating human flesh, and he 
				sure enjoyed it.<br><br>
				In any case, he devoured some Gods and linked the fire,
				then his body of cinder was took to the tomb. When he 
				awakened he marched from the Cathedral to Anor Londo 
				to have a gift from Sullyvan, Gwyndolin. It is possible
				that when we fight him he is still devouring the god 
				of the darkmoon, since we still see part of him. If 
				this is right the it means that Priscilla is alive, 
				since he had a dream about her while devouring Gwyndolin.
				</p>

				<div class="lore_content">
				<h1>Farrons Undead Legion</h1>
				<img src="legion.jpg">
				<p>Farron's Undead Legion of Abyss Watchers partook 
				of the blood of an ancient wolf, the Wolf's blood 
				linked the Abyss watchers to their master, the 
				legendary Artorias of the Abyss. Emulating Artorias, 
				the Abyss Wachers guard against creatures from the 
				Abyss. The Abyss Watchers swore on their share Wolf's
				blood to relink the Flame.<br><br>
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="lore_content">
				<h1>Lothric, the Last Hope</h1>
				<img src="lothric.jpg">
				<p>Lothric refused to relink the Flame, choosing 
				instead to allow the Flame to fade as he watched 
				it from a distance with his brother.<br><br>
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="lore_content">
				<h1>Yhorm the Giant</h1>
				<img src="yhorm.jpg">
				<p>Yhorm the Giant sought to end the Profaned flame by 
				relinking the First Flame. Instead of Eliminating the 
				Profaned Flame, the capital burned killing all except Yhorm.  
				Pontif Sulyvahn travelled to the Profaned Capital and saw the
				Profaned Flame. This hints that Yhorm linked 
				the Flame before Aldrich.<br><br>
