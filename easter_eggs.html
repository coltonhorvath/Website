				<p>Easter Eggs</p>
				<ul>
					<img class="left" src="oscar.jpg" />
					<p>At the Cemetary of Ash, you pick up the Ashen Estus Flask from the corpse 
					of what appears to be Oscar of Astora, the character who gave you the Estus Flask 
					in the first Dark Souls. In the past he was barely alive but still gave you 
					his last estus. In this game however, he only had ashen estus left and was 
					sadly unable to keep himself alive.</p>
					<img class="right" src="evangelist.jpg" />
					<p>Next to the bonfire in Profaned Capital you can find the corpse of Laddersmith 
					Gilligan from Dark Souls 2, probably dead from the strain of smithing all the 
					insanely long ladders in this game.</p>
					<p>In the Demon Ruins, Quelana's corpse can be found holding her pyromancy 
					tome, leaned against a giant spider which is probably the White Queen or Quelaag. 
					It is unknown if the duo passed together or separately.</p>
					<p>The Evangelist seems to be extremely similar to Demon's Souls Fat Officials. 
					Their attire is similar, they both have dialogue, and they both use pyromancies.</p>
					<p>Inside a cave in the poison swamp of Farron Keep, near the Farron Keep 
					Perimeter bonfire, there's a dead mushroom that resemble Elizabeth from the 
					Oolacille Sanctuary. In front of the mushroom is a corpse clutching the Golden 
					Scroll, which contains most of the sorceries that Elizabeth taught. There's also
					a chest there containing Dusk's dress, the Antiquated Set. Dusk and Elizabeth 
					are closely connected characters from the first Dark Souls.</p>
					<img class="wolf" src="wolf.jpg" />
					<p>The Old Wolf of Farron is most likely a reference to Sif, the Great Grey Wolf. 
					It is lying in front of a large gravestone, reminiscent of the graveyard 
					in Darkroot Garden. Ranking up in the covenant also grants the Wolf Ring and 
					Wolf Knight's Greatshield, both prior possessions of Artorias.</p>
					<p>Havel's weapon and gear can be found in the Archdragon peak. His armor 
					can be found on a corpse in Farron Keep near the Stray Demon once his revenant 
					is defeated.</p>
					<img class="orn" src="orn.jpg" />
					<p>Dragonslayer Ornstein's weapon and armor can be picked up off of the floor 
					near the Nameless King boss fight. His armor describes that Ornstein was 
					looking for him and it can be assumed that his armor was either put down 
					or abandoned without conflict as there is no corpse accompanying them.</p>
					<p>Gastly figures are seen roaming near Central Irithyll in a similar 
					manner to how the Black Knights roamed the Kiln of the First Flame in 
					the original  Dark Souls</p>
					<img class="fire_keeper" src="fire_keeper.jpg" />					
					<p>The Fire Keeper is very reminiscent of the Maiden in Black from 
					Demon's Souls. Both wander the hub area, level you up, talk while in 
					the menu, and lack eyes.</p>
					<p>The Giant Blacksmith's corpse can be found in Anor Londo. We can assume 
					that he died smithing as he is in the same position. Luckily Andre, also hailing 
					from the original game, is still alive and well.</p>
