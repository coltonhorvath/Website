				<h1>What you should know when getting into Dark Souls</h1>
				<img src="tips1.jpg">
				<p>Dark Souls 3 demands careful movements and strategy. Its 
				explanations of gameplay systems and mechanics are vague. The 
				game instead leaves players to figure out the intricacies over 
				many hours of gameplay. However, with just a few small considerations 
				you can significantly reduce your chances of seeing that soul-crushing “You Died” 
				screen.<br><br>
				These are 10 essential tips to help you in your journey 
				through the kingdom of Lothric. Some of these are general best
				practice rules to guide you through the game, while 
				others shed more light on specific systems.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Experiment With All Classes</h1>
				<img src="tips2.jpg">
				<p>Dark Souls 3, like its predecessors, allows players to 
				build characters that suit different play styles. While it may seem natural 
				to pick a character wielding a sword and shield at the start, you may 
				find over time that you prefer ranged attacks or wish you were 
				a quick-footed thief. Don't be afraid to restart the game and 
				experiment with another class.<br><br>
				Don't fret over classes too much though. You can start out a Pyromancer
				and still roll a max-strength knight. The classes are there to give you
				small boosts in how you want to play in the beginning of the game.
				There's one class that starts out with all stats at their lowest base
				so you can freely build him however your heart desires.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Learn From Mistakes</h1>
				<img src="tips3.jpg">
				<p>Class designations in Dark Souls 3 aren't as rigid as they initially seem. 
				Generally they just determine the stats you start with, adding more skill 
				points to disciplines appropriate for the chosen class. A warrior will 
				begin the journey with higher strength stats, for example, while a magician's 
				numbers will be tweaked so the character is more miracle-capable 
				from the outset. These boosts give you a running start down the character 
				development path, but Dark Souls 3 is open enough to allow you 
				to branch out.<br><br>
				With enough souls, you can take your sword-and-board character and turn it into 
				a pocket mage. If this is your plan, make sure you do it from the start and 
				spread out your upgrades among the appropriate stat categories. As the 
				game progresses, it takes considerably more souls to level up each time, 
				so teaching your old dog new tricks becomes much harder.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Plan Your Work, Work Your Plan</h1>
				<img src="tips4.jpg">
				<p>To overcome the challenges Dark Souls 3 places in your path, 
				you have to be studious. You need to observe the enemy, 
				identify weak points and opportunities to attack, then seize 
				on them without overextending. In each new enemy engagement, 
				your immediate strategy should be defensive: raise your shield, 
				stay mobile, observe your foe’s movement.<br><br>
				Making note of how enemy attacks look is vital because it 
				allows you to find a safe distance, then counter-attack at 
				the ideal moments. For Bloodborne players, this is a crucial 
				point because Dark Souls 3 does not make concessions for offensive 
				play. When you take damage, you can't recover it by immediately 
				striking back as you can in Bloodborne, and you'll virtually 
				never have enough Estus, which is main method of healing in 
				Dark Souls 3, to make up for repeated missteps. Rewarding 
				gambles is not built into the core of its gameplay. You are no 
				longer a sentinel Hunter, you are the fragile Ashen One. Remember that.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Learn To Love Death</h1>
				<img src="tips5.jpg">
				<p>The world of Souls is all about cycles of death and 
				rebirth; its greatest heroes understand this and use it to 
				their benefit. If you respawn at a bonfire having learned what 
				mistakes led to death, you should consider this a victory. 
				It’s a small one, for sure, but an important one.<br><br>
				On your first playthrough, every new area will throw a 
				different set of challenges at you, and it is natural--almost a given--that 
				you’ll falter at these points. Similarly, it’s rare that you’ll 
				beat a boss the first time around, so you should think about 
				each initial encounter as a fact-finding mission. Limit yourself 
				to using only Estus, so you’re not pointlessly wasting 
				consumables that aren’t replenished at a bonfire. The biggest 
				pitfall newcomers face is giving in to the thinking the game 
				is cheap, too difficult, or not balanced properly. Everything 
				is doable, it just requires strategy and, most importantly, 
				determination. Dark Souls is only as difficult as you allow it to be,
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Heal Effectively</h1>
				<img src="tips6.jpg">
				<p>Dark Souls 3 uses a number of gameplay systems from 
				across the series but also introduces a few new ones. 
				There are intricacies to the way health, focus, and 
				stamina work that are not explained in a way that’s easy to 
				understand. Much of it becomes evident as you get deeper 
				into the game, but it’s nice to have a handle on it from the 
				start. The red health bar has two states that correspond to whether 
				your character is unkindled or kindled.<br><br>
				When unkindled, you have less total health than when you 
				are kindled. You can consume Embers to transform from a shrivelled 
				undead to a kindled warrior coursing with fire. However, since 
				Embers are in limited supply, it’s important to make the 
				most of each one, so use one when your health is low instead 
				of when it’s already at max. This extends the total size of the 
				health bar and gives you a free refill. For Bloodborne players, 
				it’s worth keeping in mind that Estus flasks are replenished 
				at Bonfires, unlike Blood Vials. However, you’ll get considerably 
				fewer uses out of them, so play smart.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Focus on Focus</h1>
				<img src="tips7.jpg">
				<p>The second of the three bars relates to Focus, which 
				governs the use of Battle Arts--a new gameplay addition 
				to the Dark Souls series. Many of the weapon classes have 
				a unique ability associated with them. These range from a 
				war cry that temporarily boosts attacks to a defensive 
				stance that lets you parry to a quickstep that moves you 
				behind enemies (ideal for the offensive style of Bloodborne 
				players).<br><br>
				The amount of Focus used varies depending on the specific 
				ability but, like health, the bar is replenished at Bonfires. 
				It also has its very own blue Estus flask that can be 
				used to top it up. To start with, each character can use 
				an Estus flask four times, three times for health and once 
				for focus. However, by speaking to the blacksmith at your 
				shrine, you can redistribute these.<br><br>
				It doesn’t cost you anything to redistribute your Estus 
				allotment, so keep in mind that you can change your 
				gameplay strategy to match the situation you're preparing 
				to encounter. If your plan is to go all out on a particular 
				boss with normal attacks, you may want to move your 
				entire allotment of Estus’ to health. Or if you feel 
				like your skill is more important than health recovery, 
				you can shift it to Focus.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Manage Stamina</h1>
				<img src="tips8.jpg">
				<p>The final of the three bars is stamina, which governs 
				rolling, back steps, sprinting, blocking, and attacking. 
				Stamina usage requires the most micromanaging as, if not 
				given the proper attention, it can leave you in a lot of 
				trouble. Many abilities are hindered if stamina is depleted, 
				especially your range of movement, your defense, and your 
				attacking ability. This means that when you’re attacking 
				an enemy, pay attention to how much stamina you’re using, 
				because if you spend all of it, you won’t be able to 
				roll away quickly or hold up your leaving you at the mercy 
				of the enemy.<br><br>
				Stamina recovers relatively quickly, so for the most part, 
				it shouldn’t be a problem to keep on top of it. But it’s 
				important to note two things; First, stamina is used when 
				you’re holding your shield up and defending. If an enemy 
				is unleashing a volley of attacks, turtling isn’t a good 
				idea unless you know your attacker will finish before you 
				run out of stamina and there won’t be an immediate follow-up.
				In many scenarios, a pre-emptive dodge may be the better option. 
				The second thing to note is that your stamina recovery is 
				slower when your shield is raised, so when you have a moment 
				of safety, lower your shield to quickly recover stamina.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Don't Get Greedy</h1>
				<img src="tips9.jpg">
				<p>Souls are the currency of the game and can be exchanged
				for items, weapons, and armour, and can also be used for
				crafting and levelling up. They are accumulated by killing
				enemies, selling items, or finding the faded souls of 
				fallen warriors. Use them or lose them! Upon death, all
				the souls in your possessions are dropped wherever the 
				killing blow was struck. The good news is that you can 
				return to that point and pick them up. The bad news is if 
				you die again before you do so, they’re gone forever.<br><br>
				For this reason, it’s a good idea to avoid situations 
				where you have a significant number of souls on you. 
				Take every opportunity to cash them to level-up or buy 
				consumables. At the same time, it’s important not to 
				become too attached to Souls, as it can lead to making 
				costly mistakes. As with with item pickups placed in the 
				environments, be suspicious and cautious. It’ll save 
				your neck more than a few times.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Don't Get Greedy</h1>
				<img src="tips10.jpg">
				<p>Various spells, weapons, and armour have stat requirements 
				that must be met before they can be wielded effectively. 
				A character that doesn’t fulfill these requirements may 
				still be able to equip an item, but it will be less 
				effective when used. For a greatsword, for example, 
				the time it takes to swing the weapon may be significantly 
				increased. For a shield, it may take much longer to 
				raise it and reduce less damage.<br><br>
				In the stat menu for each item, there is usually a number 
				denoting the strength, dexterity, intelligence, or faith that 
				you need to use it. If you haven’t reached that number, it will 
				be red. Another thing to consider, particularly for 
				weapons, s the scaling grade the item has in each of 
				the aforementioned categories. The better the grade the 
				more effective it will be as you level up that stat. So 
				a rapier that has a B next to the dexterity stat will 
				become even more powerful as you spend Souls to improve 
				your dexterity. On the other hand, if a hammer has an E 
				grading for strength, it may be worth finding an alternative 
				as your strength gets higher.
				</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="tips_content">
				<h1>Engage in Jolly Cooperation</h1>
				<img src="tips11.jpg">
				<p>Multiplayer is one of the most enjoyable aspects 
				of the Dark Souls series, but it's also quite 
				difficult to understand. Each Dark Souls 3 player 
				inhabits their own world, but at times these overlap.
				The most frequent manifestations of multiplayer are
				in the soapstone messages and bloodstains. Orange 
				writings on the ground are messages from other players,
				which can provide you with advice or warnings. 
				Some players even use them to trick people, so beware. 
				Bloodstains, meanwhile, can be touched to see the 
				last few moments of another player’s life. This is a
				good way to scout upcoming dangers.<br><br>
				In your inventory you'll also find a White Sign 
				Soapstone, which can be used to place a summoning 
				point on the ground. Players in other worlds can 
				interact with these to summon you. If you’re in human
				form (Embered) you’ll also see these white signs in your 
				world, so you can recruit other players or NPCs to
				your cause. While in human form, players and NPCs 
				can forcefully invade your world as Red Phantoms 
				using Red Eye Orbs, and when this happens you’ll 
				have to face them in combat. The rewards for defeating
				an invader include souls and Embers and new weapons.
