				<h1>Miyazaki Gives Clear Answers On The Future Of Dark Souls, Armored Core</h1></a>
				<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Brian Ashcraft - 9/21/16</p>
				<img src="miyazaki.png">
				<p>During a recent round table at Namco Bandai headquarters in Tokyo, I 
				asked From Software&#39;s Hidetaka Miyazaki about the future of Dark Souls, 
				as well as what else the studio is working on. The good news is yes, a 
				new Armored Core is coming. The bad news is that, at least for the foreseeable 
				future, more Dark Souls is not.<br><br>
				At least, not from Miyazaki himself.<br><br>
				The backstory: In 2015, when talking about Dark Souls III, Miyazaki 
				said it was <q>not the final product for the Dark Souls series,</q> 
				adding that it was a <q>turning point.</q> This summer Miyazaki told the 
				Japanese press he was <q>put[ting] the Dark Souls series on hold for a while.</q><br><br>
				<q>This is because it was never our real motive for From Software to be the Dark Souls-only company.</q><br><br>
				This week in Tokyo, when I asked if Dark Souls was finished or if there&#39;d be more, 
				Miyazaki had more to say.<br><br>
				<q>For me, Dark Souls III is the end,</q> he said. <q>But that doesn&#39;t mean the 
				end for Dark Souls. If someone other than myself, like another staff member, 
				wants to make a Dark Souls, then I don&#39;t want to deny others from making 
				future installments.</q><br><br>
				(Note that when Bandai Namco&#39;s interpreter originally translated 
				this for the other Western journalists at the roundtable, 
				he left out the part in which Miyazaki said this was the end 
				of Dark Souls for him at least. I mentioned that Miyazaki did in 
				fact say that, and the interpreter re-translated that bit for the 
				other game writers.)<br><br>
				Part of the reason he felt this way, Miyazaki continued, was 
				because there are people who like Dark Souls very much, and 
				he doesn&#39;t want to unilaterally end the series. <q>I&#39;m also not 
				saying we should steer clear of making dark fantasy games,</q> he 
				added. <q>I&#39;m not ruling that out!</q><br><br>
				Miyazaki was asked what he thought about how Demon&#39;s Souls 
				and Dark Souls have created their own subgenre and how other 
				titles appear heavily influenced by Souls series to the point 
				where the games&#39; basic mechanics seem to appear in other games.<br><br>
				<q>I don&#39;t really think that way,</q> he said. <q>I don&#39;t think how we&#39;ve created a new genre.</q> 
				If anything, he said, he feels proud that Dark Souls has probably made it 
				easier for similar titles to come out. <q>There were other developers who 
				probably wanted to make games like this,</q> Miyazaki said. <q>If I&#39;ve created 
				the environment for those games to be released, then I&#39;m honored.</q><br><br>
				Regarding the use of Souls mechanics in other games, Miyazaki had 
				an equally diplomatic answer: <q>Even if the game mechanic is the same, 
				the approach might be different. For us, that&#39;s interesting.</q> 
				It ends up being research of sorts for the Souls team, who can 
				see how different developers put their own spin on what the 
				Souls team has created. <q>I&#39;ve just never thought about other 
				games mimicking ours.</q><br><br>
				Following up on what Miyazaki said earlier this summer, I asked him what 
				he thought about game studios that continue to churn 
				out new entries in the same series for years.<br><br>
				<q>It&#39;s not bad if you keep making new games in the same series
				if you think there is more to add to it,</q> Miyazaki said,
				adding that the reason why he&#39;s no longer going to do Dark
				Souls is that he doesn&#39;t think he can add more to it.<br><br>
				Currently, From Software is working on a couple titles that,
				as Miyazaki said, are <q>not just dark fantasy and mecha.</q> 
				(Though it does sound like they are making a title that 
				should please Dark Souls fans.) One of the games they are
				developing is <q>a little weird,</q> Miyazaki said.<br><br>
				I asked if the game itself is weird or if it&#39;s a weird title for 
				From Software. <q>When I say &#39;weird,&#39; the genre might be a little weird,</q> 
				he replied. <q>The game is weird. But we are diligently making it 
				in all seriousness, so I just want people to know that when
				they think it&#39;s strange.</q><br><br>
				Miyazaki has long wanted to switch up what From Software does. 
				Back in 2014, he told Famitsu, <q>I feel that From Software&#39;s 
				title lineup will need a little more variation... We have dark 
				fantasies like Dark Souls, of course, but I&#39;d also like for
				us to make more mech games like Armored Core, or Asian style 
				titles like Tenchu or Otogi: Myth of Demons. From Software 
				used have a lot more rather quirky titles.</q> When Famitsu 
				asked what kind of game he&#39;d like to make, Miyazaki replied,
				<q>There are lots of games I&#39;d like to make. I&#39;ve said this before,
				but I&#39;d really like to make a &#39;warm&#39; game. Something like 
				Popolocrois or ICO.</q> Miyazaki added, <q>Also, this is a bit of
				a dream, but I&#39;d like to make some kind of analog game. Something 
				like a board game, a card game, or a tabletop RPG.</q><br><br>
				The most obvious question, then, was whether or not From 
				Software was making a new entry in its long-running mecha series.
				I asked if they were making a new Armored Core to which he replied,
				<q>We are making a new Armored Core. We are still in the early stages 
				of development.</q> I asked how early, and Miyazaki replied, <q>I can&#39;t
				talk about how early it is.</q><br><br>
				The most recent Armored Core console title, Armored Core: Verdict Day, was released in 2013.<br><br>

				<h1>Dark Souls 3 Glitch Lets Speedrunners Completely Break The Game</h1></a>
				<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Patrick Klepek - 6/08/2016</p>
				<img src="broken.gif">
				<p>It&#39;s been a few months since Dark Souls 3 came out, and speedrunners have 
				greatly reduced their times due to a glitch that lets them cut 
				through huge parts of the game. This run took only 36 minutes and
				43 seconds!<br><br>
				I&#39;ve written about Dark Souls 3 speedrunner Distortion2 in the past, 
				one of the first people to start dismantling From Software&#39;s sequel.
				He hasn&#39;t let up in the months since, slowly bringing down his overall 
				time. When we last checked in on Distortion2, he&#39;d finished the game 
				in an hour, 12 minutes, and 36 seconds. Since then, Distortion2 has 
				halved that.<br><br>
				One of the big reasons Distortion2 is able to pull this off is due to
				the teardrop glitch, in which players cast the tears of denial spell
				to survive an intentional death. Tears of denial allows the player
				to hit 0 HP and recover to 1 HP. This is used by players to exploit
				a gap in the world geometry, one that should kill their character, 
				and break the game.<br><br>
				Distortion2 and other speedrunners are then able to navigate their
				way to other parts of Dark Souls 3, skipping many so-called <q>required</q>
				bosses.<br><br>
				In a patch that went live yesterday, From Software removed this glitch.
				The patch shouldn&#39;t stop speedrunners; they can merely refuse to update 
				the game and play offline. But when the DLC arrives later this year and 
				speedrunning expands beyond the base game, it&#39;ll lead to a splintering 
				in speedruns. This is natural and often happens with modern games, though.

				<h1>Dark Souls 3&#39;s Patch Notes Are Maddeningly Vague</h1></a>
				<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Patrick Klepek - 6/08/2016</p>
				<img src="news1.jpg">
				<p>Dark Souls 3 has been getting patches on a regular basis, since the game 
				was released in April. But for hardcore fans, the release of a patch is
				only the beginning; then, the community has to find out what the patches do.<br><br>
				The game&#39;s developer, From Software, usually releases patch notes, 
				but they&#39;re often vague and don&#39;t point out what&#39;s actually changed.<br><br>
				Take this excerpt from the next patch, which drops on Friday:<br><br>
				Adjusted the attack power and skills of fist and claw weapons<br><br>
				OK, yes, it&339;s clear that fist and claw weapons have been adjusted...but 
				how? Have they been nerfed, reducing their attack power? Did From Software
				instead realize they were underpowered, forcing them to buff the weapons?<br><br>
				We’re unlikely to know the answer until the patch arrives, and even then,
				if you&#39;re someone who wants to know the specific values From Software 
				shifted around, there&#39;s no way to surface that without people data mining.<br><br>
				In the Dark Souls community, Textralia on reddit is one of 
				the most reliable data miners, putting together comprehensive 
				posts for the most hardcore.<br><br>
				<q>Since detailed patch notes are a myth at FROM software,</q> 
				said Textralia in a recent analysis post, <q>I&#39;ve taken the 
				liberty of doing a little datamining for the 1.06 regulation
				update as promised.</q><br><br>
				From Software isn&#39;t alone in this regard, though. Nintendo has been 
				famously shy about changes made to the Smash Bros. games, 
				leading people to wildly (and annoyingly) experiment when
				patches are dropped. Here&#39;s how Nintendo described a patch 
				for the 3DS version of Super Smash Bros.:<br><br>
				Adjustments will be made to balance the game.<br><br>
				Other adjustments will be made to make for a more pleasant gaming experience.<br><br>
				It was BS then, and it&#39;s BS now. Lots of things about Dark 
				Souls benefit from mystery, but how the game functions? Balance 
				changes? C&#39;mon.
